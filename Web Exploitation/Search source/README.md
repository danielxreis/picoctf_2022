Description
The developer of this website mistakenly left an important artifact in the website source, can you find it?
The website is [here](http://saturn.picoctf.net:61941/)

## Solution
This one is the same of others. Open Inspect Elements and search for the flag. I found the flag using "Source Tab" and checking file by file, the flag was inside `style.css`.

## **Flag:** `picoCTF{1nsp3ti0n_0f_w3bpag3s_8de925a7}`
