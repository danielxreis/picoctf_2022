Description
Can you get the flag?
Go to this [website](http://saturn.picoctf.net:55826/) and see what you can discover.

## solution

Entering on the website we already start with the Developer Tools. In the first page we find nothing relevant. But then, we insert any credentials on the form to check what kind of return the page will gave to us.

I tried with the credentials `admin` for user and `admin` for password. It will redirect us to a page called "login.php" with a failed message. Now we can check this new discovered page. 

In this new page, in the <body> tag, we can see in plain sight, the embed script called "secure.js", inside this file we can see also in plain sight what kind of verification this website is doing to check what are the valid credentials. Not best practing in web development.

```javascript
function checkPassword(username, password)
{
  if( username === 'admin' && password === 'strongPassword098765' )
  {
    return true;
  }
  else
  {
    return false;
  }
}
```
With that, we can insert the right credentials in the previous page and retrieve the flag.
