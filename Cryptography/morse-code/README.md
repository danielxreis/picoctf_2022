Description
Morse code is well known. Can you decrypt this?
Download the file [here](morse_chal.wav).

Wrap your answer with picoCTF{}, put underscores in place of pauses, and use all lowercase.

## Solution

For this one, we could translante it by hearig using some guide in internet like [morsedecoder.com](https://morsedecoder.com/), but since we have the raw file with us, we can use audio online decoder like [this one](https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html). Upload the file, organize the flag and send it.

**Result from Morsecode.world:** WH47 H47H 90D W20U9H7

## **Flag:** `picoCTF{WH47_H47H_90D_W20U9H7}`
